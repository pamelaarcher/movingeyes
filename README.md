## Description
This project creates two eyes and eyeballs that follow the mouse movement around the screen.  It defines both the eye and eyeball as classes that are then used by the javascript to check for a mouse move and based on the location of the mouse, moves the eyeballs in the same direction.

  - <b>index.html</b> which creates the divs for the for the eyes and the eyeball.  
  - <b>eyes.js</b> which checks for the on mouse move event and based on its location,  moves the eyeball positions in the same direction
